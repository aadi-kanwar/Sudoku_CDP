### Solving Sudoku with Constraint Satisfaction and Heuristics

Develop a system to solve Sudoku puzzles using constraint satisfaction techniques and
heuristics. The system should be able to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles by formulating
them as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and applying methods such as constraint
propagation, backtracking search, and heuristics to find solutions.
